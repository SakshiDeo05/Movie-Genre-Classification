# Movie-Genre-Classification
In this notebook an algorithm that determines the genre of a movie based on its summary on the IMDb database is fitted. The database that is used for training contains the description of 54214 movies of 27 different genres some of which are drama, comedy, thriller, crime, and scifi. To solve this task, a general vocabulary was formed out of the "n" most used words in each genre's description. Then, each description was encoded using CountVectorizer according to this vocabulary. Finally, a multinomial naive bayes algorithm with Î±=0.7 was chosen as the optimal classifier. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.53, a weighted average precision of 0.54 and a weighted average recall of 0.53.
